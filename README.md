# About project
The involved creating two sub-systems invetory and ordering sub-systems, utilizing multithreading techniques and rabbitmq to make a simulation
The results were benchmarks using rust benchmarking tools to see its performance

To start the simulation go to the root dir in the terminal and run: Cargo build, then run: Cargo run
